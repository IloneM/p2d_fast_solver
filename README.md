# P2D Fast Solver

This repository contains the fast solver for pseudo-2D model of Li-ion battery based on Finite Difference Method. The model is taken from the P2D model outlined in the [paper](http://web.mit.edu/braatzgroup/Torchio_JElectSoc_2016.pdf) by Torchio et al.
Run `run_main.py` to run the fast solver.
